# [Hands-On Angular: Connect to an API][published url]
## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]

If you want to create a web app, at some point you'll need to connect to an APIâ€”whether to save user data, retrieve real-time information, or access data from another source. In this course, you'll learn how to access an API from an Angular app. Along the way, I'll show you some powerful tips and tricks, including how to create a fake back-end to make testing easer, and how to make some of the most common HTTP requests with Angular's `HttpClient`.

## Source Files Description:

This repository contains the completed source code for the course project: a simple RESTful API client with a demo server for testing purposes.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
